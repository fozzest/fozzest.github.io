  </ul>Main Selling PointMain Selling Point: Versatility and athleticism Age18.7 Height/Weight6'7''/285 Wingspan6'10''
  <p>Gravity-breaking athlete with the all-around skill to be one of the league’s best superstars.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Charles Barkley, Blake Griffin, Julius Randle
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Capable of running pick-and-roll as a ball handler; the team that drafts him can use him in virtually any role on offense.</li>
    <li>A potential five-position defender with a rare combination of strength, agility, and anticipation skills; he can comfortably switch on-ball screens.</li>
    <li>Zion’s explosive jukes and hop-steps are glitches in the laws of physics; a player his size shouldn’t be able to create separation the way he does.</li>
    <li>A wrecking-ball finisher who can finish through and above contact; his size, athleticism, and ballhandling ability will lead to a lot of defensive fouls drawn.</li>
    <li>Dangerous on dives to the rim via pick-and-rolls and handoffs; he can flush lobs like DeAndre Jordan or pass on the short roll like Draymond Green.</li>
    <li>A smart, unselfish passer who thrives in transition; he lacks supreme vision, but his excellent rebounding and coast-to-coast ability are valuable tools.</li>
    <li>Punishes smaller players on perimeter drives and post-ups. Has basic moves now, but displays the dexterity and body control necessary to improve.</li>
    <li>An active and aware cutter who can exploit holes in defenses, even when they sag off him on the perimeter.</li>
    <li>Hustles and plays with a winning mind-set: dives for loose balls, rebounds out of his area, and pursues chasedown blocks.</li>
    <li>Defensive playmaker who alters shots and jumps passing lanes to spark transition chances, though in a pro system he’ll have to gamble less frequently.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Clunky spot-up shooting mechanics; he brings the ball to his set point too early, which hurts momentum into his shot. Also needs to kick his strange habit of jab-stepping before he shoots.</li>
    <li>Developing a jumper off the dribble is the key to unlocking his full potential; he shoots the ball flat and looks uncomfortable even from the elbow.</li>
    <li>Must learn how to change gears to minimize sloppy passes or out-of-control drives that lead to charges.</li>
    <li>He can be predictable: He overuses the drop step on post-ups, and he rarely uses his right hand on shots near the rim. He needs a more diverse arsenal of moves on drives and post-ups.</li>
    <li>Defensive awareness could use fine-tuning; often falls into upright stance, ball-watches, and misses help rotations.</li>
    <li>Defensive discipline is lacking; though he makes explosive plays, savvy opponents will throw moves that make him leave his feet, or crash the boards when he overhelps.</li>
    <li>With his size and explosiveness, health is always a question: He suffered a right foot bruise in high school that put him in a walking boot, sprained his MCL at Duke, and has been out of shape in the past.</li>

  <h3>R.J. BARRETT</h3>
  <h4><strong>Forward</strong></h4>

    <li>FT% 66.2 201 FTA</li>
  </ul>Main Selling PointMain Selling Point: Scoring Age18.8 Height/Weight6'7''/202 Wingspan6'10''
  <p>Physically gifted scorer who’s won at every level, but needs to sharpen his raw skills to flourish in the pros.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Jalen Rose, alpha Andrew Wiggins, Harrison Barnes, Rudy Gay
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Good athlete in space with smooth footwork who seeks contact on drives.</li>
    <li>Dangerous ball handler who takes long strides and uses a bevy of herky-jerky maneuvers like Euro-steps and hesitations to get to the rim.</li>
    <li>Effective shooter off the dribble from midrange: He’s comfortable transitioning into his shot, especially when driving left, and he’s flashed a slick stepback.</li>
    <li>Good ball handler and passer for his size who can make any type of pass off the dribble. Though he’s not a pure playmaker, he can fit into any multi-ball-handler offense.</li>
    <li>Excellent rebounder for his position; when he snatches boards, he’s a constant threat to go coast-to-coast.</li>
    <li>Competitive defender at lower levels, especially playing for Team Canada. He has the physical profile to be a versatile defender with long arms and strong frame.</li>
    <li>Team Canada has poured resources into his development; he has a strong work ethic, and a history of improvement suggests he’ll continue progressing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>He induces face-palms by forcing contested shots early in the clock, barreling into defenders instead of passing to open players, and attempting wild passes to bail himself out.</li>
    <li>He rarely uses his right hand, as if it were tied behind back. It’s critical that he improve his off hand to diversify his shot-creation ability.</li>
    <li>His lousy percentages from 3 and the line are alarming since he has good, consistent mechanics.</li>
    <li>Lacks natural touch, an issue that is compounded by his diminished athleticism in tight space, which hinders his at-rim scoring.</li>
    <li>Inactive off-ball player on offense: He rarely ever cuts or screens at Duke, though his athleticism and versatility could make him a potential threat down the road.</li>
    <li>He’s a ball watcher off-ball who routinely misses defensive rotations; on-ball, he often falls out of his stance possibly due to a lack of interest, awareness, or energy.</li>

  </ul>Main Selling PointMain Selling Point: Athleticism Age19.6 Height/Weight6'3''/175 Wingspan6'7''
  <p>Athletic wonder and clever playmaker who needs to develop his jump shot and curb turnovers to unlock his true star potential.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Skinny John Wall, Donovan Mitchell, Dennis Smith Jr.
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Electric passer who generates open space for teammates with speed and sleights of hand, and then accurately delivers the ball using either hand off the dribble.</li>
    <li>Excellent shot-creation upside. He has a quick first step and uses slippery crossovers, spins, in-out dribbles, and changes of pace to create space.</li>
    <li>Major potential as a transition threat with his handle, speed, and unselfish passing ability.</li>
    <li>Touch from the line and around the rim suggests he could be a good shooter if he makes the necessary mechanical changes.</li>
    <li>Terrific athlete who explodes for open-floor dunks and has the top-gear speed to zoom by defenders. Crafty finisher who absorbs contact well, though he still must get stronger.</li>
    <li>Has the instincts of a role player, too: does the little things like cutting, rebounding, and facilitating within the flow of the offense.</li>
    <li>Solid on-ball defender when he’s playing with intensity, which doesn’t happen often enough.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Too tricky with his dribble, forces passes into shutting windows, and is nonchalant making simple passes, all of which lead to avoidable turnovers.</li>
    <li>Needs to overhaul his shooting mechanics: His release is too low and his elbow sticks out. The ball gets pushed from his forehead. He’s a natural lefty who shoots righty.</li>
    <li>Must improve his right hand. Becoming more of a one-foot leaper would enhance his finishing, too.</li>
    <li>Struggles shooting jumpers off the dribble largely due to his poor mechanics, which cause him to transition slowly into his release.</li>
    <li>Motor and focus wane when defending off-ball, leading to backdoor cuts and open shooters. Is it due to his heavy offensive role, or is it for a lack of interest?</li>
    <li>Narrow frame limits his defensive upside. He’s not someone who can switch onto larger players.</li>

    <li>FT% 70.4 169 FTA</li>
  </ul>Main Selling PointMain Selling Point: All-around game Age20.1 Height/Weight6'6''/195 Wingspan6'10''
  <p>Versatile wing who can fill myriad roles and has a lane to become a primary shot creator if his handle keeps improving.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Khris Middleton, Malcolm Brogdon, Jeremy Lamb
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Intelligent player who moves well without the ball, fills lanes on the break, and plays hard.</li>
    <li>Good straight-line driver who mixes in spin moves and finishes with either hand around the rim, though he must improve at finishing versus length.</li>
    <li>Solid dribble-jumper shooter; comfortable taking side dribbles into 3s, pull-ups, and stepbacks, though his footwork will need to improve at the pro level.</li>
    <li>Makes tough shots, especially from midrange. If those 2s become 3s, he could become an end-of-game scorer.</li>
    <li>Flashes upside shooting off screens and handoffs, though his below-average free throw percentage and lack of touch on floaters are worrisome indicators for his actual shooting ability.</li>
    <li>Unselfish passer who facilitates well within the system and can make plays off the bounce for others. Shows good feel with change-of-pace moves in the pick-and-roll.</li>
    <li>Competitive rebounder who can initiate a fast break as a scorer or playmaker.</li>
    <li>Versatile defender who can comfortably defend multiple positions and be relied on off-ball to make smart rotations and take calculated risks going for steals.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Stiff ball handler with an average first step. He lacks shake after his initial move, which forces him into a ton of tough shots.</li>
    <li>Tweaked his shooting form to remove a hitch, though his slow and rigid release raises questions about his accuracy at the next level.</li>
    <li>Takes far too many unforced midrange 2-pointers early in the clock.</li>
    <li>Telegraphs too many passes and lacks accuracy, so at this stage he’s more of a secondary ball handler than a primary creator.</li>
    <li>Limited ceiling as a defender: He has room to get stronger, but he still has a relatively lean frame, and he has only average lateral quickness against guards.</li>

    <li>FT% 75.9 108 FTA</li>
  </ul>Main Selling PointMain Selling Point: Scoring upside Age19.5 Height/Weight6'8''/218 Wingspan7'1''
  <p>Polarizing prospect who looks the part of a future star scorer, but his production leaves much to be desired.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Paul George, Rashard Lewis, bigger Ben McLemore
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide upper body with a long wingspan that can support more muscle, though his hips are slender; added strength could improve some of his weaknesses.</li>
    <li>Fluidity, size, and an array of ball-handling moves and hesitations enable him to hit pull-up perimeter jumpers that most players can’t.</li>
    <li>Projects as a plus shooter off the catch due to his quick, high release. With his size, he could develop into a pick-and-pop threat.</li>
    <li>Does a fine job of relocating off-ball and cutting, though the results aren’t great due to a lack of explosiveness inside and a streaky shot outside.</li>
    <li>Good passer for his size: He’s adept at creating space and making reads in the pick-and-roll, though he’s had limited opportunities due to the presence of star teammates.</li>
    <li>Switchable defender with long arms and quick hands to swipe at ball handlers; he defends on his heels too much, though, which hinders his lateral quickness.</li>
    <li>Though Reddish underwhelmed at Duke, he accepted his role without any complaints, which bodes well for his ability to do what his future team asks of him.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Reddish doesn’t maximize his physical gifts. He’s long but takes short, choppy steps attacking the rim; he’s large, but avoids contact when driving or rebounding.</li>
    <li>Loses balance on drives to the rim; he lacks coordination, slips and falls, and will fumble the ball even without pressure.</li>
    <li>Settles too much for jumpers despite only appearing like a knockdown shooter; his mechanics look smooth, but he’s shot low 30 percent from 3 throughout his career.</li>
    <li>Not an above-the-rim finisher in traffic, and he avoids using his off hand; converts on plays around the rim at a much lower rate than you’d expect.</li>
    <li>Telegraphs too many passes; he plays a casual overall game, and needs to put zip on the ball to get it where he wants it to go.</li>
    <li>Lacks discipline on defense: He falls for pump fakes, reaches too often, and gambles in situations when he should just play positional defense.</li>
    <li>Defensive effort flutters too much; his mind-set could be the difference between becoming Paul George or Jeff Green.</li>

  </ul>Main Selling PointMain Selling Point: Defensive versatility Age22.5 Height/Weight6'8''/215 Wingspan6'10''
  <p>A super-versatile defender who plays team-first basketball and has made encouraging progress on offense.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Paul Millsap, Pascal Siakam, Kris Humphries
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Impressively logged as many blocks as missed shots during the regular season at Gonzaga.</li>
    <li>Explosive leaper with soft hands to catch tough passes, and the ambidexterity and spatial awareness to finish in a crowd.</li>
    <li>Good decision-maker. The type of player who plays “good to great” basketball by grabbing a rebound and locating an open teammate instead of forcing up a careless, contested shot.</li>
    <li>Handles the ball well for his size; he can take rebounds and go coast-to-coast. He’s mostly a straight-line driver but likes using a spin move to his right.</li>
    <li>Sets solid screens, and has good feel and timing on dives to the rim; with his passing and dribbling skill, he could be a weapon on the short roll.</li>
    <li>Strong indicators that he will develop a perimeter game: touch on floaters, post fadeaways, hook shots, and midrange jumpers.</li>
    <li>Plays his ass off. Makes the extra effort, attacks the offensive boards, dives for loose balls, and hustles back in transition.</li>
    <li>Excellent shot blocker. He’s a fast-twitch leaper who perfectly times his jumps and uses the rule of verticality to alter shots without fouling.</li>
    <li>Projects well as a pick-and-roll defender. Has the agility to hedge and help, and the recovery speed, anticipation, and switchability to take on wings and guards.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Unless he develops a spot-up 3, he’ll need to play like a center on offense, which could create matchup issues for his team.</li>
    <li>Ideal role is small-ball 5, but a lack of length and strength will hinder his ability to defend larger elite bigs like Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns.</li>
    <li>Underwhelming defensive rebounder given his athletic gifts.</li>
    <li>Shooting upside is only theoretical: He overhauled his form after transferring from San Jose State to Gonzaga, but he still has rigid release and shoots a mediocre percentage from the line.</li>

  <p>Unflashy 3-and-D forward who will translate in the NBA as a multipositional defender and reliable spot-up shooter.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Luol Deng, DeMarre Carroll, Jae Crowder
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Good spot-up shooter who has a sense for relocating and cutting, though he should quicken his shooting release.</li>
    <li>His shot creation has improved considerably; he can get to the rim on straight-line drives, make basic one- or two-dribble pull-ups, and face up from the post.</li>
    <li>Good on-ball perimeter defender due to his notable combination of mass, length, and quickness.</li>
    <li>Plays sound positional defense off-ball; he rotates well, minimizes mistakes, and has the bulk to neutralize rim runners when helping in the pick-and-roll.</li>
    <li>Stout post defender due to strength, length, and strong base; he’s hard to overpower.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Average first step and handle limits his scoring upside.</li>
    <li>While a good defender, he does tend to get smoked by quicker, explosive players—which he’ll see far more of in the NBA.</li>
    <li>Unless he has space to gather, he’s a below-the-rim finisher who doesn’t finish well inside against contact or lengthy defenders.</li>
    <li>Questionable feel for the game; he’s a ball stopper who makes delayed reads, though he has made significant progress as a passer each season.</li>
    <li>Lacks defensive playmaking skill; doesn’t log many explosive plays in the blocks or steals columns though it’s partially a product of Virginia’s defense scheme.</li>
    <li>Solid rebounder, though he’ll need to show more skill to excel in a small-ball frontcourt role.</li>

  <p>High-effort defender and complementary offensive player.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Otto Porter Jr., Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Garrett Temple
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Decisive scorer; he grabs the ball and goes when attacking closeouts or sprinting in transition, taking long strides on his way to the rim.</li>
    <li>Improving 3-point shooter who has good touch on floaters, which helps dampen any concerns about his funky, leaning shooting form.</li>
    <li>Hard-nosed rebounder unafraid to mix it up with bigs.</li>
    <li>Plays with effort and passion. He’ll dive for loose balls, close out hard on the perimeter, and take a charge.</li>
    <li>Theoretically a good defender due to his energy if his fundamentals improve.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>High, loose dribble limits his ability to create scoring opportunities for himself. He relies on brute force on straight-line drives, and lacks any finesse with the ball in his hands.</li>
    <li>Robotic passer who doesn’t make advanced reads.</li>
    <li>A below-the-rim finisher in traffic who doesn’t handle contact well and lacks the length to extend for layups. He also rarely uses his left hand finishing and dribbling.</li>
    <li>He’s heavy-footed moving laterally since he’s on his heels, and he bites for far too many fakes.</li>
    <li>He’s a ball watcher prone to allowing backdoor cutters and open shooters.</li>

  <p>Team-first player who runs the show from the post in college but will need to expand his game to the perimeter at the next level.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> P.J. Tucker, Spurs-era Boris Diaw, Treveon Graham
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Crafty interior scorer who finishes with either hand and uses deceptive pump fakes to create space; loves to carve out space for his left-handed runner.</li>
    <li>Excellent screener who can facilitate on the short roll or pop for 3s; can be a playmaking weapon on switches.</li>
    <li>Tennessee runs its offense through him on the post; he loves absorbing contact, can finish over either shoulder, and throws accurate fastballs to cutters and shooters.</li>
    <li>Improved spot-up 3-point shooter. He must extend his range, but his touch from the line and midrange is a positive indicator for his projected shooting ability.</li>
    <li>A high-IQ defender who is always in the right position rotating as a help defender, and plays with strong fundamentals moving laterally.</li>
    <li>Plays tough, physical individual defense. He closes out hard and shows active hands, plus he’s an instinctual rebounder who boxes out.</li>
    <li>Hard-working, unselfish player. Lost weight and got better each season. He’ll take a charge or dive for a loose ball. Bonus: He does a good job of accentuating contact to draw fouls.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Reluctant to shoot 3s, passes up open looks, and dribbles into short midrange pull ups. Does he lack confidence or is he aware of his limitations?</li>
    <li>Lacks verticality, so scoring inside against NBA length will require an adjustment.</li>
    <li>He doesn’t project as a shot creator because of his average first step and lack of shake as a ball handler.</li>
    <li>Tweeners don’t exist in today’s NBA, but athleticism still matters: He might not have the mobility to be a top-shelf defender on switches against guards and quicker wings.</li>

  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Ambidextrous dribbler and scorer, comfortable with executing in-out dribbles and crossovers, and at-rim finishes and floaters, with either hand.</li>
    <li>Good spot-up shooter who displays instincts for relocating and cutting to get open.</li>
    <li>Passing might be his best NBA skill: He’ll wow you with off-the-dribble left-handed passes to shooters in the corner.</li>
    <li>Fluid ball handler who plays with poise in the pick-and-roll; it looks like he’s coasting but he’s always under control.</li>
    <li>Flashes post scoring skills; with his playmaking, he could use the post as a source for playmaking as a big guard like Evan Turner.</li>
    <li>Long, competitive defender who should be able to effectively defend both guard spots.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Struggles finishing in the paint since his average athleticism means he doesn’t get much elevation.</li>
    <li>More likely a secondary playmaker than a primary due to his lack of burst.</li>
    <li>Ineffective 3-point shooter off the dribble, possibly due to his catapult-like shooting mechanics, where he brings the ball back to his forehead and then launches.</li>

  <p>Disruptive defender who posted all-time great block and steal numbers as the pillar of Washington’s zone.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Danny Green, Gary Harris, Tony Allen
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Beast off-ball defender potential: He’s both athletic and smart. He closes out strong, alters shots, and recovers well after penetration.</li>
    <li>Remarkable anticipation skills and reaction time allow him to jump passing lanes like he’s Deion Sanders.</li>
    <li>Doesn’t take his athleticism for granted; constantly hustles, pursues loose balls, and hurries back in transition to stop the ball or contest a shot.</li>
    <li>Projects as a switchable man-to-man defender with long arms and good fundamentals moving laterally and staying seated in his stance.</li>
    <li>Despite his hyperactivity on defense, he rarely commits fouls, though he’ll need to break his freelancing habit in the NBA.</li>
    <li>Above-average 3-point shooter with compact form, and a good free throw shooter with touch around the rim.</li>
    <li>Smart player who passes well within the flow of the offense and avoids careless mistakes.</li>
    <li>Ambidextrous below-the-rim interior finisher who can score well off cuts and closeouts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Tough to evaluate his man-to-man defense since he last played it as an underclassman when Lorenzo Romar used a switching scheme that hemorrhaged points.</li>
    <li>Weirdly a nonfactor on the defensive boards despite his athleticism and instincts.</li>
    <li>Timid, deferential offensive player. It’s not necessarily a bad thing since he knows his role, but he’s yet to tap into his athleticism.</li>
    <li>Needs to speed up his jump shot release, and too often flares out his elbow, which may be a cause of inconsistency.</li>
    <li>Not someone who will create many at-rim chances for himself. He can make simple moves but hasn’t shown he can keep the ball on a string.</li>
    <li>At-rim finishing is lacking but could improve if he develops athleticism leaping off one foot.</li>

  <p>Explosive, highly regarded 3-and-D recruit who hasn’t shown much in college, but was a late bloomer in high school and history could repeat itself.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Andre Iguodala, Harrison Barnes, Stanley Johnson
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Ideal body for positionless basketball with a thick, muscular frame, long arms, and explosive athleticism.</li>
    <li>Switchable defender who can potentially lock down multiple positions due to his strength and raw quickness—but only if his fundamentals dramatically improve.</li>
    <li>Stout defender against bigs and larger forwards due to length and strength; he’s hard to move with his strong base.</li>
    <li>Good rebounder at the wing thanks to his athleticism.</li>
    <li>Lob threat off cuts. He could also be used as a roller in the pick-and-roll due to his explosiveness and ability to absorb and finish through contact.</li>
    <li>Comfortable attacking closeouts to get to the rim.</li>
    <li>Shows flashes pulling up from short midrange. He’s also a good free throw shooter, which suggests he has long-term 3-point upside.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Flaky off-ball defender who loses track of his man due to ball-watching, fails to help, and has trouble navigating screens.</li>
    <li>Gets caught out of position too often defending quicker players, which leads to blow-bys. He’s too much of a turnstile for a player with his physical profile and effort level.</li>
    <li>Adding weight in college has allowed him to be a big for UNC, but it’s sapped him of the lateral quickness that made him an elite high school defender.</li>
    <li>Looks puzzled on offense. He record-scratches the offense, pauses, settles for contested pull-ups, and dribbles into traffic instead of locating open teammates.</li>
    <li>Lacks fluidity driving the ball. He has some crossovers and in-out dribble moves, but he’s stiff.</li>
    <li>Struggles spot-up shooting. He has some bad misses, including air balls.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Good passer for his position; has vision from all over the floor, though he does tend to force some passes into tight windows.</li>

    <li>Rapidly improving spot-up 3-point shooter who projects to have NBA range.</li>
    <li>Mobile on-ball defender with long arms and a stout frame, though he doesn’t quite have the size to be an enforcer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Lacks explosiveness in traffic, which means he won’t be much of a pick-and-roll threat to throw down lobs or finish with power.</li>
    <li>Needs to diversify his offense: He rushes too many wild shots and lacks any advanced post moves; defenders will know he’s going to his right hook.</li>
    <li>Below-average defensive rebounder who doesn’t display a nose for the ball; his teams may get abused on the boards if they use him as a small-ball 5.</li>
    <li>Inconsistent motor and focus while defending off-ball or boxing out; doesn’t always make hustle plays like diving for loose balls and taking charges.</li>

  <p>Athletic marvel who projects as a skilled offensive big man, but his defense needs to catch up.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Derrick Favors, Enes Kanter, Festus Ezeli
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Body seems to have been built in a lab; possesses a thick frame and long arms to go with agility and explosiveness.</li>
    <li>Ambidextrous interior finisher who displays good footwork finding space for layups—that is, when he isn’t already in position to throw down pulverizing dunks.</li>
    <li>Soft interior touch and clean shooting form suggest he has a projectable shot to the NBA 3-point line.</li>
    <li>Made drastic improvements as a passer as a sophomore; he puts velocity on the ball and can effectively facilitate on the short roll and in the low and high post.</li>
    <li>Maryland plays at a snail’s pace, but Fernando is a force like Montrezl Harrell running the floor when he’s empowered.</li>
    <li>Good rebounder who can follow his boards with strong outlet passes. Considering his quick first step and aptitude for straight-line driving, maybe he can also handle in transition.</li>
    <li>Long-term rim-protection upside; his fundamentals must improve but he has what you can’t teach—length and mobility.</li>
    <li>Plays with better, more consistent intensity on defense than he did as a freshman; his overall improvement is a sign of a willingness to learn.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Sets a lot of moving screens that’ll get called early in his pro career.</li>
    <li>Needs to be careful about bringing the ball down while loading up before dunks, since it leaves him prone to being stripped.</li>
    <li>He doesn’t handle the pressure of college double-teams well; will standard NBA pressure and length by superior defenders also give him issues executing plays?</li>
    <li>Unaware defender who often gets caught in no-man’s-land; he lacks positional awareness in the pick-and-roll and is still learning the intricacies of help defense.</li>
    <li>Athleticism can only go so far without fundamentals: He has improved but still bites on too many pump fakes inside and reaches too much on the perimeter.</li>

  <p>Unusual athlete who has the body to defend large players and the raw skills to play guard on offense.</p><strong>Shades Of:</strong> Eric Gordon, Deonte Burton
  <h6>PLUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Shot-creation skills are uncommon for a player with his body: He unleashes NBA Street–style moves to generate space to get buckets.</li>
    <li>Solid spot-up shooter from a stationary position, though his low, robotic release may not be as effective against NBA length.</li>
    <li>Makes difficult cross-court passes off the dribble, and has keen passing vision that could be cultivated in the NBA.</li>
    <li>Good rebounder who high-points the ball and sparks transition offense by taking the ball up the floor.</li>
    <li>Long arms and strong frame theoretically give him the ability to switch screens, using his length to swallow guards and bulk to battle bigs.</li>
    <li>Youth. He turned 18 in November, so there are untapped skills for a team to mature.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>MINUSES</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Poor free throw shooter who doesn’t display touch on floaters or layups, which doesn’t inspire much confidence in the upside of his jumper.</li>
    <li>Shot selection is problematic. He takes far too many contested pull-ups with lots of time left on the shot clock.</li>
    <li>Erratic decision-maker driving the ball. He forces wild shots underneath the rim instead of locating shooters.</li>
    <li>Loose handle that sometimes comes up above his shoulders. He needs tighten it up or won’t be nearly as effective in an NBA setting.</li>
    <li>Slow moving laterally on defense. He’s often out of position and plays float-footed, but with his thick frame and wide hips, he just might not be quick enough on the perimeter.</li>
    <li>Low-effort defender who doesn’t play with passion, toughness, or focus. Defensive consistency is a teamwide issue though, so he could be a product of the environment.</li>
