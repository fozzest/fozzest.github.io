    <h1>Assignment 02: Ideas in Form</h1>

      <h4> An explorative research exercise, studying traditional Japanese architecture and it's connections to wood and nature, and how they can be applied to contemporary design.</h4>

      <h2 style="color:red;">TOPIC: IN JAPANESE ARCITECTURE, WOOD IS A SIGNIFICANT SYMBOL OF THE CULTURE"S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BROADER NATURAL ENVIRONMENT</h2>

      <h3>Initial Research</h3>

       <strong><i>Quick Mapping:</i></strong> <p>I collaborated with fellow classmate Ola. We had a shared passion for history, and used that as a central point to jump of of and explore some possible topics for research. Below is some of our first explorations.</p>

      <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/mind01.JPG" style="height:40%; width:40%;box-shadow: 2px 2px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);"></div>

      <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/mind02.jpg" style="height:40%; width:40%;box-shadow: 2px 2px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);"></div>

       <p> <strong><i>Topic Scoping:</i></strong> <p>After generating ideas, it became important to start scoping our topic, figuring out where our research should be directed.</p>

      <p><strong>Broadest: </strong><i>Human's historic relationship to natural disasters</i></p>

      <p><strong>Broader: </strong><i>Japanese design and the natural environment</i></p>

      <p><strong>Broad: </strong><i>How Japanese architecture evoke's and responds to nature.</i></p>

      <p><strong>Yummy: </strong><i>Wood as a significant symbol in Japanese Architecture representing a broader Japanese connecion to nature.</i></p>

      <p><strong>Too Narrow: </strong><i>The use of chibori wood-joining techniques as a symbol of the Japanese interest in representing trees in traditional architecture.</i></p>


      <h3>First Probes:</h3> <p> Listed below are some of the first articles, journals, and pieces that we found interesting. These guided us to our more focussed topic.</p>

      <p>This source provides information and general background on the Japanese connection with nature going as far as to showing the importance in language. 
      </p>  

       <p><strong><a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1659/0276-4741%282004%29024%5B0179%3ATFARIJ%5D2.0.CO%3B2">Trees, Forests and Religion in Japan</a></strong></p>

      <p>Article depicting contemporary Japanese architect Kengo Kuma’s design practice, which utilises a modern interpretation the Japanese use of wood in structures.
 
      </p>  

       <h3>Topic Selection</h3>

      <h2 style="color:red;">I am studying <strong>THE USE OF WOOD IN JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE</strong> because I want to find out <strong>HOW CULTURES USE MAERIALS TO DESIGN FOR AN IMPERMANENT ENVIRONMENT</strong> to support making<strong> OBJECTS THAT CAN ENDURE AND ADAPT TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS.</strong></h2>

       <p><strong><a href="http://kkaa.co.jp/works/architecture/prostho-museum-research-center/">Kengo Kuma’s GC Prothso Museum and Research Center (2010)</a></strong></p>

      <p>A masterpiece in contemporary Japanese Architecture, Kengo Kuma’s GC Prostho Museum and Research Centre underpins a modern aesthetic by using traditional Japanese cedar and construction techniques such as chidori joinery. A fascinating design, this structure points to the return from Japanese architects to traditional materials, despite the prevalence of Western practices throughout the 20th century.

      <p><strong><a href="http://www.nara.accu.or.jp/img/elearning/2006/tradition.pdf">The Tradition of Wooden Architecture in Japan</a></strong></p>

      <p>The following source is a report given by the Agency of Cultural Affairs in Japan that outlines many characteristics in Japanese, such as post-and-beam construction, materials, roofing, and craft. There is a discussion on how these aspects of Japanese architecture take into account the natural resources surrounding them, as well as the events and patterns of nature, such as earthquakes, decay, and the movement of people.

      <p>An insightful report that analyses and compares Japanese traditional architecture with Western thought. The paper assesses a number of contemporary Japanese architects and works, and focuses on the idea that the Japanese home looks to embody nature, rather than observe it (like many homes in the West.) By structuring an argument around the prevalence of modernism and the ‘box’ throughout the world Matthew Kubota studies what traits allowed Japanese architecture and construction to stand the test of time.
