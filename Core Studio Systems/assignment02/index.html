    <h1>Assignment 02: Ideas in Form</h1>

      <h4>The following is a five-day exploration, where every day  research, experimentation,and documentation culminated in a new artwork. Fascinated in learning more about cultures, I used the first location presented by AirBnB.com as a source for guiding my art making practice, sending me to both familiar and unfamiliar locations. Every day resulted in an new discovery, a new interest, and a new idea I would like to continue along with. <br> An interest in history, language, and the effects of environment on place became key tocuhpoints that navigated my works together.</h4>
