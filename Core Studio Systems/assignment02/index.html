    <h1>Ideas in Form</h1>

      <h4> An explorative research exercise, studying traditional Japanese architecture and it's connections to wood and nature, and how they can be applied to contemporary design. The first stage of this research was conducted with fellow student Ola. A broad interest in historical relationships between humans and natural disasters led to our inquiry into Japan and it's use of natural materials. The subject of impermanence and the ability to adapt to change was inspirational to us as designers.</h4>

      <h2 style="color:red;">TOPIC: IN JAPANESE ARCITECTURE, WOOD IS A SIGNIFICANT SYMBOL OF THE CULTURE"S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BROADER NATURAL ENVIRONMENT</h2>

      <h3>Initial Research</h3>

       <strong><i>Quick Mapping:</i></strong> <p>I collaborated with fellow classmate Ola. We had a shared passion for history, and used that as a central point to jump of of and explore some possible topics for research. Below is some of our first explorations.</p>

      <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/mind01.JPG" style="height:40%; width:40%;box-shadow: 2px 2px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);"></div>

       <p> <strong><i>Topic Scoping:</i></strong> <p>After generating ideas, it became important to start scoping our topic, figuring out where our research should be directed.</p>

      <p><strong>Broadest: </strong><i>Human's historic relationship to natural disasters</i></p>

      <p><strong>Broader: </strong><i>Japanese design and the natural environment</i></p>

      <p><strong>Broad: </strong><i>How Japanese architecture evoke's and responds to nature.</i></p>

      <p><strong>Yummy: </strong><i>Wood as a significant symbol in Japanese Architecture representing a broader Japanese connecion to nature.</i></p>

      <p><strong>Too Narrow: </strong><i>The use of chibori wood-joining techniques as a symbol of the Japanese interest in representing trees in traditional architecture.</i></p>

    <h2>Japanese Joinery Through the Lens of Kengo Kuma: Two 3D Studies</h2>

    <h4>Inspired by the findings of my previous research, I wanted to take a deeper dive into how contemporary Japanese architects utilise traditional themes and forms. I looked into the body of work of Kengo Kuma, renowned internationally for his respect for traditional Japanese craft and materials.</h4>
      <h4>The following two pieces explore two of his more famous works, which use different wood joinery techniques and repition as a way of creating space through structure.</h4>

      <h3>Chidori in the GC Prostho Museum Research Centre:</h3> <p> Though Kuma's work is a study of repition of form, I was interested in first learning more about the actual joinery used for this project.</p>

      <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/chidori_gc.png" style="height:40%; width:40%;box-shadow: 2px 2px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);"></div>

        <p><i>Inside the GC Prothso Museum.</i></p>

      <p>From the architect:<i>This is architecture that originates from the system of Cidori, an old Japanese toy. Cidori is an assembly of wood sticks with joints having unique shape, which can be extended merely by twisting the sticks, without any nails or metal fittings. The tradition of this toy has been passed on in Hida Takayama, a small town in a mountain, where many skilled craftsmen still exist.</i></p>
      
      <p>I studied other projects by Kuma and examples of Cidori furniture and toys to form the plan for producing my own Cidori furniture. The subsequent project was difficult and required patience with the wood, but provided many learnings for perhaps reproducing it on a larger scale.</p>

      <p><i>Making a prototype. Used the japanese saw and chisel, finished with sandpaper. This was a very frustrating process, with multiple mistakes and wrong orientations of cuts.</i></p>

<br>

      <h3>Yusuhara Bridge:</h3> <p> I was fascinated in resarching how small cuts and stacking could create more complex forms and incredible strenght and sturdiness.</p>

      <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/yusahara.jpg" style="height:40%; width:40%;box-shadow: 2px 2px 14px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);"></div>

        <p><i>Yusahara Bridge from 2011.</i></p>

        <p>From the architect: <i>Accumulation of hanegi evokes the traditional construction method of “to-kyo”(square framing) employed in Japan and China, which was devised to support the load from the eaves. By repeating this method persistently to the scale of a bridge, we were able to present a completely new expression of architecture, while keeping its Asian appearance.

        <h4>After taking a deeper dive into the use of wood in Japanese architecture, I wanted to again exapnd as a way of reinforcing the patterns I was finding. I went to Iceland to see how traditional Icelandic homes also used environmental materials in their own construction practices.</h4>
          <h4>The following photographic series is a study of turf homes in Iceland, a common construction technique that began nearly 1000 years ago.</h4>
    
          <h3>Keldur Turf Houses:</h3> <p> With some projections dating the structures to be much earlier, the Keldur farm turf houses are siad to be at least 1000 years old. They are famous for being some of the best preserved examples of icelandic turf/sod homes. They were famously stated in the well known Njal’s Saga, and the hall strucutre is the oldest of its kind in Iceland. </p>

  <h2>Recapping Through Teaching: An Interactive Study</h2>

  <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/acreens.png" style="height:100%; width:100%;"></div>

      <h4>Throughout researching this topic, I kept coming back to the thoguth that the techniques I was studying and how they relate to one another were not documented, and hard to learn about without a lot of digging. Wanting to teach others about my findings and the values of traditional Japanese Architecture and how it can be applied today, I decided to create an educative interactive digital experience.</h4>
      <h4><i>JOINERY OF KENGO KUMA AND ASSOCIATES: House of Wood, House of Land </i>is a short exploration into how we can share the craft and technique of contemporary architects like Kengo Kuma who employ traditionl Japanese construction techniques. Japanese architecture is most effective when it creates a dialogue between structure and environment. I wanted to play off this idea, and design a digital experience, creating 3D forms that exist in the 2D environment many of us are most comfotable with. It was my goal to teach and inform throuhg playful interaction and exploration.</h4>

      <div class="imgLay"> <img src="images/hero.png" style="height:100%; width:100%;"></div>

      <P>Whilst I felt the Keldur home photographic study was valuable in that it provided me with an alternative perspective on how cultures use natural materials to better exist in their environemnts, the exploration provided more context and comparison rather than truly pushing my research into Japanese architecture further.</P>
        
        <p>Becasue of that, for this study, I returned more closely to some of the earlier references I studied. I recalled how difficult it was for me to conceptualise the joinery needed to achieve these massivley complex structures. In designing this interactive work, it was important for me to create an educative experience that articulated the forms truthfully and legibly.</p>
         <p>One of the things that was inspirational to be about Kuma's work is his use of traditional technique, but more importantly his subsequent repetition of form and construction. He reduces large-scale construction practices down into micro-units, which he then repeats to create complex and expansive architectual forms.</p>
        <p>I wanted to show how these complex units/joints could be quickly scaled up to create the large pieces that Kuma has built.</p>

        <br>

        <p>This prototype is just a short glimpse into a project that I am very passionate about, and like Kuma's own work, is designed to be scaled up. I only have highlighted two structures, Yusuhara Bridge, and GC Prothso Research Museum. These works directly impacted my research over the course of this topic, but I would like to continue to expand what projects and joinery are showcased here.</p>
        
        <p>I used Sketch and Flinto to build the screens and then add animations and transitions. It was quite a mind twist and puzzle learning how to properly visually display the joints. From a craft standpoint, I learned a lot about layering in visual design software, and using smoke and mirrors to achieve transitons and changing position (ie the wood blocks moving to cover certain portions of other blocks).</p>

    <br>
    <p>The following is a screen recording of the interactions and user flow that can be experienced in the study. </p>
