    <p><a href="https://www.bain.com/">Bain<a/> is a world-renowned consultancy, with a rising digital presence under the name of ADAPT (Advanced Digital and Product Team). As the first ever intern at ADAPT, I took on a range of projects, including the production of a ‚Äòproduct story‚Äô of one of our clients, which we will call Cend.

    In order to share this story, Cend had to be redesigned for client confidentiality. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into how brand identity can be visually addressed in the digital product, both with broader strokes such as colour and font, but also less tangible qualities such as nuanced motion and grid systems.

      Though Kuma's work is a study of repition of form, I was interested in first learning more about the actual joinery used for this project. Learning about how Cidori was constructed became the basis of my 3D study.
