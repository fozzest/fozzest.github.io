  Ideas in Form is a short term investigative research project that explores how cultures, particularly the Japnanese, use the natural environment to inform and construct their architectural works. The project included background research, wood-working, and motion design, culminating in a digital protoype of an educative mobile experience regarding Japanese wood joinery.

    <p>
    The beginning of this concept rose from my passion with history and natural materials and my observations on the differences between Japanese and Western models of architectural design and urban growth. Additionally, I had recently become obsessed and inspired by the contemporary Japanese architect Kengo Kuma.
<br><br>Japanese architecture tends to lean on organic materials, and structures in Japan are replaced more rapidly than in countries in Europe and North America. Yet despite this impermanence, the architecture of Japan evokes something deeply emotional and connective; it has a certain feeling and voice that isn‚Äôt found in many newer Western homes.
With this in mind, I wanted to learn more about what gives both traditional and contemporary (read: Kengo Kuma) Japanese architecture its voice, and then share this voice with those around me.

      Motion design was themed to heighten the imporvements introduced by the Bain team, including the fluid and simple sign-up process. Editing shots to sound gave the film a pop feel and kept the audiences engaged and excited. Further beauty shots enhanced the overall immersion of the film and placed the product in the real world, or less 'protoype-y' settings.

      Inspired by the findings of my previous research, I wanted to take a deeper dive into how contemporary Japanese architects utilise traditional themes and forms. I looked into the body of work of Kengo Kuma, renowned internationally for his respect for traditional Japanese craft and materials.

    <i class="text-italic">This is architecture that originates from the system of Cidori, an old Japanese toy. Cidori is an assembly of wood sticks with joints having unique shape, which can be extended merely by twisting the sticks, without any nails or metal fittings. The tradition of this toy has been passed on in Hida Takayama, a small town in a mountain, where many skilled craftsmen still exist.</i>

      Though Kuma's work is a study of repition of form, I was interested in first learning more about the actual joinery used for this project. Learning about how Cidori was constructed became the basis of my 3D study.
      <br><br>
      First, a micro-sized MVP was produced....

      ...Followed by a larger construction that provided me with a newfound respect for how certain Japanese joints were produced, and how these forms can be beautiful as individual sculptures, or used to produce much larger habitations.
