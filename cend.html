    <p><a href="https://www.bain.com/">Bain<a/> is a world-renowned consultancy, with a rising digital presence under the name of ADAPT (Advanced Digital and Product Team). As the first ever intern at ADAPT, I took on a range of projects, including the production of a ‚Äòproduct story‚Äô of one of our clients, which we will call Cend.

  <p>
  Bain was approached by a major fintech company to help solve issues around onboarding potential customers. After major improvements and accomplishments from the case team, it became evident that this story was worth sharing accross Bain and with potential clients.
</p>
  <p>
   My role in this project begins once the case work was wrapped. During my time with ADAPT at Bain, I rebranded the fintech company as Cend, rebuilt the designed screens to match this new brand identity, and created a film that eloquently illustrated the case team's success. 
    Through this process, I gained valuable insights into how brand identity can be visually addressed within digital products, and how the narrative of a case can be told authentically and passionately in film.

    <p>Cend's original sign-up process was lengthy, requiring more than 5 steps and 18 fields. The ADAPT team reduced these down to a single page, and were keen to show this off in the sanitiesed designs and film I was working on.</p>

    <p>In creating the sanitiesd version of the product, I devised a new hypothetical name and logo that evoked the improvements that ADAPT had produced during the case work. This formed the basis for the rest of my visual exploration, which included an extensive dark-themed iteration. We eventually settled on the fluid but sophisticated navy scheme you see today.</p>

    Beyond just sanatising the work done by the ADAPT, the team was interested in showing how they assessed and tackled key problems in re-designing Cend. Whereas previous ADAPT videos may have focussed more on the final product, it was important
    to the team that this video illustrated a user-centred process, with effective and postivie user-centric outcomes.

  <p>
  Sanitising Cend so the case work and product could be shared required us to create a new visual identiy for the product, whilst simultaneously keeping intact the hard work done by the ADAPT team. Whilst we flirted with a dark-themed version of the app with hi-vis colours, we eventually settled on the colour-scheme you see today, trusting and mature blues, with entergetic and lively elements of orange and yellow.

<p>
  Icons and imagery were codified in their overall round shape and heavy, white stroke line drawings. I experimented with fluidity to support the concept
  of ease of movement in the redesigned app, which can be seen in some explorations below. The final icons reflect the liquidity I wished to show, but were more restrained in their overall form.
  The intention was to make the elements simplified and legible, and to heighten the sensation of movement with micro-animations in select moments within the product.

    <p>
      Alongside storyboarding and writing the script, I edited and animated the sequences shown in the film.
Taking inspiration by famous Apple product launch films, I was careful to consider that the objective of this video was not just to illustrate the product, as many of the previous films for Bain had been, but to tell the entire process story. By creating wireframes that grew and evolved, I illustrated iteration and change without requiring the audience to invest too much energy into viewing charts and data. 
A fast-paced narrative and imagery of growth and change keep the energy high, and the flow moving forwards.

    <p>
      Motion design was themed to heighten the imporvements introduced by the Bain team, including the fluid and simple sign-up process. Editing shots to sound gave the film a pop feel and kept the audiences engaged and excited. Further beauty shots enhanced the overall immersion of the film and placed the product in the real world, or less 'protoype-y' settings.
